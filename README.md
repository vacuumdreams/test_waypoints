# Code test
## Overview
This test is designed to be small enough to not take too much time, but loose enough that you will be able to show your own
architectural solutions as well as your code structure.
### Hypothetical background
A fullstack engineer needs to be able to tackle both frontend and backend tasks. This coding challenge is designed to provide
Planet with an idea of your ability to create an API and communicate with it from a JavaScript page.
### Requirements
- Backend
- - Create an API that provides an endpoint to create and retrieve waypoint coordinates
- - Feel free to choose any framework or library, but please use Python or Golang as a language
- Frontend
- - Create a basic JS application that can be used to first enter waypoint coordinates and send them to the backend and then query the endpoint and retrieve the waypoints again
- - Display the data however you see fit, whether it be in a list, a table or on a map
### Delivery
Share a code base with us in any way that makes sense to you,
when you feel that you are done. We expect your code to include a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.
### Time management
We won't be timing you. Do your best, show your skills, but keep in mind there is no reason to overdo it.
